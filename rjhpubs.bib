We propose a method for coherent forecasting of mortality

principal components models of simple and interpretable
functions of rates. The product-ratio functional forecasting
method models and forecasts the geometric mean of
subpopulation rates and the ratio of subpopulation rates to
product rates. Coherence is imposed by constraining the
forecast ratio function through stationary time series models.
The method is applied to sex-specific data for Sweden and
state-specific data for Australia. Based on out-of-sample
forecasts, the coherent forecasts are at least as accurate in
overall terms as comparable independent forecasts, and
forecast accuracy is homogenized across subpopulations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) is currently the fifth leading cause of death in
Australia, and there are marked differences in mortality trends
between men and women. In this study, we have sought to model
and forecast age related changes in COPD mortality over time for
men and women separately over the period 2006-2025. METHODS:
Annual COPD death rates in Australia from 1922 to 2005 for age
groups (50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+)
were used. Functional time series models of age-specific COPD
mortality rates for men and women were used, and forecasts of
mortality rates were modelled separately for men and women.
RESULTS: Functional time series models with four basis functions
were fitted to each population separately. Twenty-year forecasts
were computed, and indicated an overall decline. This decline
may be slower for women than for men. By age, we expect similar
rates of decline in men over time. In contrast, for women,
forecasts for the age group 75-79 years suggest less of a
decline over time compared to younger age groups. CONCLUSIONS:
By using a new method to predict age-specific trends in COPD
mortality over time, this study provides important insights into
at-risk age groups for men and women separately, which has
implications for policy and program development.},

insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system

  abstract = {In industry as well as many areas of scientific research, data
collected often contain a number of responses of interest for a
chosen set of exploratory variables. Optimization of such
multivariable multiresponse systems is a challenge well suited to
genetic algorithms as global optimization tools. One such example
is the optimization of coating surfaces with the required
absolute and relative sensitivity for detecting analytes using
devices such as sensor arrays. High-throughput synthesis and
screening methods can be used to accelerate materials discovery
and optimization; however, an important practical consideration
for successful optimization of materials for arrays and other
applications is the ability to generate adequate information from
a minimum number of experiments. Here we present a case study to
evaluate the efficiency of a novel evolutionary model-based
multiresponse approach (EMMA) that enables the optimization of a
coating while minimizing the number of experiments. EMMA plans
the experiments and simultaneously models the material
properties. We illustrate this novel procedure for materials
optimization by testing the algorithm on a sol-gel synthetic
route for production and optimization of a well studied
amino-methyl-silane coating. The response variables of the
coating have been optimized based on application criteria for
micro- and macro-array surfaces. Spotting performance has been
monitored using a fluorescent dye molecule for demonstration
purposes and measured using a laser scanner. Optimization is
achieved by exploring less than 2\% of the possible experiments,
resulting in identification of the most influential compositional
variables. Use of EMMA to optimize control factors of a product
or process is illustrated, and the proposed approach is shown to
be a promising tool for simultaneously optimizing and modeling
multivariable multiresponse systems.},

  abstract = {An innovations state space modeling framework is introduced for
forecasting complex seasonal time series such as those with
multiple seasonal periods, high-frequency seasonality,
non-integer seasonality, and dual-calendar effects. The new
framework incorporates Box--Cox transformations, Fourier
representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error
correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for
point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of
Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive
approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key
feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that
greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum
likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a
broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in
three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric
formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex
seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition
leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components
which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself.},

propose first to reduce the dimensionality by applying functional
principal component analysis to the historical observations, and
then to use univariate time series forecasting and functional
principal component regression techniques. When data in the most
recent year are partially observed, we improve point forecast
accuracy using dynamic updating methods. We also introduce a
nonparametric approach to construct prediction intervals of
updated forecasts, and compare the empirical coverage probability
with an existing parametric method. Our approaches are
data-driven and computationally fast, and hence they are feasible
to be applied in real time high frequency dynamic updating. The
methods are demonstrated using monthly sea surface temperatures
from 1950 to 2008.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of future age-specific incidence and mortality
are critical for allocation of resources to breast cancer control
programmes and evaluation of screening programmes. The purpose of
this study is to apply functional data analysis techniques to
model age-specific breast cancer mortality time trends, and
forecast entire age-specific mortality functions using a
state-space approach. We use annual unadjusted breast cancer
mortality rates in Australia, from 1921 to 2001 in 5 year age
groups (45 to 85+). We use functional data analysis techniques
where mortality and incidence are modelled as curves with age as
a functional covariate varying by time. Data are smoothed using
non-parametric smoothing methods then decomposed (using principal
components analysis) to estimate basis functions that represent
the functional curve. Period effects from the fitted coefficients
are forecast then multiplied by the basis functions, resulting in
a forecast mortality curve with prediction intervals. To
forecast, we adopt a state-space approach and an automatic
modelling framework for selecting among exponential smoothing
methods.Overall, breast cancer mortality rates in Australia
remained relatively stable from 1960 to the late 1990s, but have
declined over the last few years. A set of four basis functions
minimized the mean integrated squared forecasting error and
account for 99.3 per cent of variation around the mean mortality
curve. Twenty year forecasts suggest a continuing decline, but at
a slower rate, and stabilizing beyond 2010. Forecasts show a
decline in all age groups with the greatest decline in older
women. The proposed methods have the potential to incorporate
important covariates such as hormone replacement therapy and
interventions to represent mammographic screening. This would be
particularly useful for evaluating the impact of screening on
mortality and incidence from breast cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To measure changes in drug utilisation following a
national general practice education program aimed at improving
prescribing for hypertension. METHODS: A series of nationally
implemented, multifaceted educational interventions using social
marketing principles focusing on prescribing for hypertension,
was commenced in October 1999, and repeated in September 2001 and
August 2003. The target group was all primary care prescribers in
Australia and interventions were both active (voluntary) and
passive. Newsletter and prescribing feedback was mailed in
October 1999, September 2001 (newsletter only) and August 2003.
Approximately a third of general practitioners (GPs) in Australia
undertook at least one active educational activity (clinical
audit, educational visit or case study) during the period October
1999-April 2004. National dispensing data from 1996 to 2004 were
analysed using time series methodology with a decay term for
intervention effect, to assess trends in prescribing of various
classes of antihypertensives. In particular, the program aimed to
increase the prescribing of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers.
RESULTS: Consistent with key intervention messages, the program
achieved an increase in low-dose thiazide and beta blocker
prescribing. The rate of prescribing of low-dose thiazides
doubled from 1.1 per 1000 consultations in October 1999 to 2.4
per 1000 in October 2003. Beta-blocker utilisation showed a more
modest but significant increase over the time of the study, with
the change in observed versus expected rate of prescribing
increasing by 8\% by April 2004. Therapeutic options for treating
hypertension changed markedly in the time of the study with the
advent of ACE inhibitor/Angiotensin II receptor antagonists and
thiazide combination products. It is important, therefore, to
interpret the results in light of these changes. CONCLUSION: A
national education program aimed at GPs was successful in
improving prescribing for hypertension. Lessons learned will be
applied in evaluation of future NPS programs and are also
applicable to analysis of other interventions aimed at
influencing prescribing behaviour.},

methodology is applied to French mortality and Australian

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The National Prescribing Service Ltd (NPS) aims to
improve prescribing and use of medicines consistent with
evidence-based best practice. This report compares two
statistical methods used to determine whether multiple
educational interventions influenced antibiotic prescription in
Australia. METHODS: Monthly data (July 1996 to June 2003) were
obtained from a national claims database. The outcome measures
were the median number of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000
consultations for each general practitioner (GP) each month, and
the mean proportion (across GPs) of each subgroup of antibiotics
(e.g. roxithromycin) out of nine antibiotics having primary use
for upper respiratory tract infection. Two approaches were used
to investigate shifts in prescribing: augmented regression, which
included seasonality, autocorrelation and one intervention; and
seasonally adjusted piecewise linear dynamic regression, which
removed seasonality prior to modelling, included several
interventions, GP participation and autocorrelated errors. Both
methods are variations of piecewise linear regression modelling.
RESULTS: Both approaches described a similar decrease in rates,
with a non-significant change after the first intervention. The
inclusion of more interventions and GP participation made no
difference. Using roxithromycin as an example of the analyses of
proportions, both approaches implied that after the first
intervention the proportion decreased significantly. The
statistical significance of this intervention disappears when
other interventions are included. CONCLUSIONS: The two analyses
provide results which agree regarding the possible impact of the
NPS interventions, but raise questions about what is the best way
to model drug utilization, particularly regarding whether to
include all intervention terms when they belong to an extended
roll-out of related interventions.},

methodological shortcomings of currently available analytical
methods for single-city time series data. We analyzed daily
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and daily asthma
hospital admissions in Melbourne, Australia from July 1989 to
December 1992. Air pollution data comprised nitrogen dioxide,
ozone and sulphur dioxide and air particles index consistent
with particulates between 0.1 and 1 microm in aerodynamic
diameter. Statistical analyses were performed using generalized
linear models, generalized additive models, Poisson
autoregressive models and transitional regression models. The
estimated effect of nitrogen dioxide on COPD hospital admissions
was similar across the different statistical models, RR = 1.06
(95\% CI 1.01-1.11). Similarly the estimated effect of nitrogen
dioxide on asthma hospital admissions was also consistent, RR =
1.05 (95\% CI 1.01-1.09). However, the effects of ozone, air
particles index and sulphur dioxide were highly sensitive to
model specification for both COPD and asthma hospital
admissions. In single-city studies of air pollution and
respiratory disease, very different conclusions can be drawn
from competing models. Furthermore, real time series data have
greater complexity than any of the commonly-used existing models
allow. Consequently, single-city studies should use several
statistical models to demonstrate the stability of estimated
effects.},

the M3-competition and is therefore of interest to forecast
practitioners. The original description of the method given by
Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos [International Journal of
Forecasting 16 (2000) 521] involves several pages of algebraic
manipulation. We show that the method can be expressed much more
simply and that the forecasts obtained are equivalent to simple
exponential smoothing with drift.},
